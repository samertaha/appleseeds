   The server generated these startup warnings when booting

   Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display     
   metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

   The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
   and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
   improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

   To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
   To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()
